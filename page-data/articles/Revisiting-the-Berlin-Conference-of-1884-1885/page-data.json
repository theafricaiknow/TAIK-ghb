Africa has 54 countries encapsulating territories with interesting names, diverse geography, religion, language and culture. It is populated by beautiful and happy people. I have always wandered whether the North Africans really feel like they belong to the continent or they consider it a geographical accident.</p>\n<p>Africa is second to Asia in terms of size and population, having approximately 1.2 Billion people. The origins of the word 'Africa' are not universally agreed. There is a school of thought that postulates that the Romans first used the term 'Africa' to describe the part of the Carthaginian Empire covering present day Tunisia. Another school of thought believes that the word 'Africa' is a derivation of the Greek word \"Aphrike\" which translates as \"the land that is free from cold and horror\". Post independence, majority of African countries have maintained the names they had adopted at independence from colonial powers. A few have changed their names; Democratic Republic of Congo was renamed Zaire in 1971 and then reverted to its former name in 1997, Upper Volta was renamed Burkina Faso in 1984 while Swaziland was renamed eSwatini in 2018.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Scramble for Africa</strong> happened between 1881-1914 when several European powers made a greedy dash to claim and control Africa's wealth. This was done without any consideration and regard for the diverse Bantu, Nilotic and Cushite people that had already inhabited the continent for generations. European explorers and sea traders had been to Africa as early as the 15th Century in the Guinea coastlands. Vasco Da Gama, the Portuguese explorer, is recorded to have arrived in East Africa in 1498 while the Portuguese also landed in South Africa in the 15th Century. For context, it is important to remember that Africans have been in Africa since the creation of man or if the theory of evolution is to be believed, since <em>Homo Erectus</em> evolved from <em>Homo Habilis</em>. Africa should never have been carved up like a thanksgiving turkey.</p>\n<p><br/><br/></p>\n<img src=\"/Children.jpg\" alt=\"Children of Sultan of Zanzibar\" class='p-2 mx-auto my-auto mw-100 h-auto' />\n<p><br/><br/></p>\n<p>The Europeans were not the first visitors to Africa, they arrived later and forcibly muscled out the Arab traders who had preceded them. From the mid-8th century CE, muslim traders from Arabia and Egypt had arrived in traditional dhows and settled in Africa along the Swahili coast. Shirazi people, from Persia also arrived in 12th century CE. During the 8th Century CE, Africans and Arabs who had come to Africa mixed and created the Swahili culture. They established city states including Mombasa, Mogadishu and Zanzibar that traded across the Indian Ocean with nations in Arabia, Persia, India and China. The decline of the Swahili city states came in the 16th Century when the Portuguese arrived and destroyed the trade network to their own benefit.</p>\n<p>In 1884, the Berlin Conference was convened by fourteen European countries with an imperialist agenda to discuss the partitioning of Africa amongst themselves so that they could control Africa's vast resources. The key players included Germany, France, Great Britain, Belgium, Portugal, Denmark, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Russia, Sweden-Norway and the USA. The European countries at the conference claimed possession over parts of Africa with the aim of bringing \"Civilization\" through Christianity and Trade. At the time of the conference, about 80% of Africa was still under traditional and local control, yet Africa was not represented at the conference. By dividing Africa into 50 irregular geometric boundaries or countries, the conference legitimized the plundering of Africa's natural resources, environmental degradation, enslavement and colonization of the people. Through the actions of King Leopold II of Belgium, the seeds of corruption on a kleptomaniac scale for personal benefit were also planted ( He was later sadly mimicked by Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and Jean-Bedel Bokassa of Central African Republic). The 'countries' they shared or created did not take into any consideration the diversity of Africa's cultures, regions, religions or tribes.</p>\n<p><br/><br/></p>\n<img src=\"/map-colonization-of-africa.jpeg\" alt=\"Map of colonized Africa\" class='p-2 mx-auto my-auto mw-100 h-auto' />\n<p><br/><br/></p>\n<p>The Berlin Conference set the stage for the systematic plunder of natural resources, dismantling of the mainly animalistic traditional belief systems, the suppression of folklore in favor of the written word (bible), outlawing of cultural practices that had hitherto served Africa well which were classified as \"primitive\" or \"uncivilized\" and the destruction of family and societal units. Africa has never recovered to date and the tremors of the conference are still haunting the continent. The 'divide &#x26; rule' policy that was adopted by the colonialists to dominate Africa still possess it like a demon, creating a poisoned path of corruption, greed, hatred, violence, tribalism, clannism and religious intolerance.</p>\n<p>Pre-Colonial Africa had structured matriarchal and patriarchal societies and also witnessed the rise and fall of great kingdoms like Luba-Lunda, Ashanti , Zulu and Great Zimbabwe. Polygamy &#x26; polyandry, traditional dressing, cultural practices &#x26; ceremonies, rites of passage, traditional medicine, traditional religion and folklore have been lost to 'civilization' and Christianity/Islam. I wonder if Africa gave up too much too soon because the 'civilization' of 2020 isn't rocking my boat. I don't yearn for a return to the past, but I want Africa to yank off the 'Democracy' bandage that has been applied to it's cancerous wound and get a proper cure for it's ills. How long are we going to explain away any problem by simply rolling our eyes and saying \" this is Africa?\"</p>\n<p>The state of Africa's leadership, governance and political ideology is in a complete mess. You can throw a dart against the map of Africa blindfolded and chances are very high that whichever country you hit is either undergoing dictatorship, disdain for the constitution, corruption, visionless leadership, civil strife, rigged elections and manufactured poverty. The exceptions are few and far between with a special mention to Botswana, Ghana, Senegal and South Africa which are moving in the right direction, albeit with unique challenges. Africa, like the proverbial ostrich, must stop burying its head deep in the sand and find a collective and lasting solution to the ills that are bedeviling the continent. Democracy is failing; Africa is like a junkie that is heavily dependent on regular financial fixes from 'Western' powers and financial institutions for survival. Another player, China, has aggressively joined the feeding frenzy with a skewed agenda that is best described as parasitical.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it's time for the African Union to call for a major conference to review, rewrite and renegotiate the terms of the African map that was agreed during the 1884-1885 Berlin Conference without them. This can only happen if they free themselves from being marionettes of Western forces and captives of internal greed and corruption. New countries with better social, cultural, religious and economic cohesion can arise if the will and wherewithal can be found. The concept of \"Democracy\" can also be revisited and a unique African system outside Capitalism, Socialism or Communism discussed by Africans for Africans without worrying about Uncle Tom or Aunty Elizabeth's interests and thoughts.</p>\n<p>I leave you with a quote from Simon Kapwepwe, the former Zambia Vice President between 1967-1970, <em>\"If we don't handle our independence very well, colonizers will come back in form of investors\".</em></p>","frontmatter":{"id":"9","slug":"/articles/Revisiting-the-Berlin-Conference-of-1884-1885","title":"Revisiting the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 and the Scramble for Africa","excerpt":"'The \"Scramble for Africa\" happened between 1881-1914 when several European powers made a greedy dash to claim and control Africa's wealth.

The research that does exist, depicts specific African women as heroines and the others as victims of the patriarchal society useful only for reproduction. Colonial history contributes largely to this rhetoric; Its introduction formally relegated women toward inferior positions through laws and policies. Whereas, there is significant evidence that depict African women played crucial roles in political and economic advancement.</p>\n<p><sup>1</sup>. Not only is research on African women history predominantly absent, research of\nAfricans in a social movement perspective (with the exception of South Africa) is lacking as well\n<sup>2</sup>. Yet, African women have largely been involved in social movements and have been known to\nstand up in times of extreme injustice.</p>\n<p>In the last few months of 2020, three African countries were protesting against injustice. In Nigeria, the youth were protesting against police brutality #ENDSA RS, a notorious branch of the police force that is known to extort, kidnap and kill citizens. In Kenya, mothers, sisters and wives went to the streets to protest against police brutality as well. Males were assumed to be the sole victims, however according to Missing Voices, a nonprofit tracking police violence, women in Kenya account for a third of the disappearances and killings<sup>3</sup>. And in South Africa, following the release of statistics from the South African police service that stated that, \"<em>a woman is killed every 3 hours\"</em>, protests against femicide were held in Johannesburg and Cape town<sup>4</sup>.</p>\n<p>In all three of these countries, women were at the helm of affairs. The Feminist Coalition in Nigeria, organized, raised and disbursed funds during the #ENDSARS protests. The Mathare Social Justice Centre and Mother of Victims and Survivors Network were instrumental in providing strength and purpose to victims in Kenya<sup>5</sup>. While in South Africa, the country was shocked by the turnout of women demanding action from both the private and public sectors<sup>6</sup>.</p>\n<p>In light of these amazing and brave women, we thought it would be interesting to look at the history of women at the helm of leadership in social movements in Africa.</p>\n<p><strong>1929, Aba Women's Rebellion</strong></p>\n<p>The Aba Women's rebellion is widely known as the rebellion of women in Igbo speaking and neighboring communities because of the imposition of direct taxation, new local courts and warrant chiefs<sup>7</sup>. For the women, census and taxation was more than counting and money. In Igbo Cosmology, the woman's material interests were correlated to her spiritual, so the belief was that it affected her fertility. Hence, if all women were counted and taxed, eventually, it will affect reproduction in the land, leaving all women barren – which in Igbo cosmology, is an abomination<sup>8</sup>.</p>\n<p>Many also believe that the intensity of the rebellion was due to the widespread discontent with colonial administration in the area. In Igbo society, the common woman held political rights and equal rights as her male counterparts. The introduction of the 'colonial way' undermined the women's political power and economic contribution<sup>9</sup>. In light of this, tens of thousands of women attacked corrupt district officers, burned courts and sang and chanted songs expressing their anger.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, Lord Lugard in the foreword for Sylvia Reith Ross' book <em>African Women</em> wrote, the Igbo woman …<em>\"is ambitious, courageous, self-reliant, hardworking and independent… she claims full equality with the opposite sex and would seem indeed to be the dominant partner.\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>1949, The March on Grand Bassam</strong></p>\n<p>In December 1949, an estimated two thousand multiethnic women marched to Grand Bassam – the then capital of Cote d'Ivoire to demand the release of their brothers, husbands and sons<sup>10</sup>. Many walked 30 miles from Abidjan because at the time, the French Colonial government was imprisoning anti colonial activists. The women blocked the bridge that connects the French quarter to the rest of the city. They were teargassed, shot at, forty of them were injured and four of them were imprisoned<sup>11</sup>. Unfortunately none of their loved ones were released and three of those that were imprisoned were sentenced to two months in prison<sup>12</sup>.</p>\n<p><strong>1977, Green Belt Movement Kenya</strong></p>\n<p>The Green Belt Movement in Kenya was created by Wangari Maathai with a goal of planting a billion trees worldwide<sup>13</sup>. It was developed as a response to women in rural Kenya needing to walk further for water because streams were drying up and food supply was dwindling. By the mid 1980s almost two thousand grass root women's groups were planting trees and managing nurseries<sup>14</sup>.Today, the green belt movement is amongst the largest civil society organizations with over 100,000 women participants<sup>15</sup>. The women plant income generating tress that contribute to other issues behind widespread poverty – deforestation, environmental degradation, soil erosion, lack of water and food insecurity.</p>\n<p>In light of the broader issues raised, the Green Belt movement began to advocate for accountability from national leaders and to create a broader democratic space<sup>16</sup>. It has brought people together to increase their quality of life and contribute meaningfully to improving the environment.</p>\n<p><strong>2003, Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace</strong></p>\n<p>During the 2nd Liberian Civil War, the country was known for the prevalence of child soldiers. The military was doing everything in its power to stop the war, but to no avail. Then, a social worker, Leymah Gbowee with the help of community leaders mobilized women from churches and mosques to end the violence<sup>17</sup>. She stated in her autobiography, that after having a dream where Muslims and Christians were praying together for peace, only mothers could stop the violence. With the help of an organization named WIPNET (Women in Peacebuilding Network) spearheaded the Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace.</p>\n<p>The Women were known for their white scarves, white dresses and \"corridor lobbying\". They held sit-ins in the Monrovia fish market, they waited for negotiators as they entered and exited meeting rooms and even staged a sit-in at the Presidential palace<sup>18</sup>. Then in 2003, during the peace talks between the rebel groups and Charles Taylor, several hundred women camped outside the delegates hotel in Accra and threatened to rip off their clothes if a peace agreement was not reached. With that pressure, a peace agreement was signed within weeks<sup>19</sup>.</p>\n<p>Each of these movements could easily be written about at length. Nevertheless, we thought it was important to highlight the depth and breadth of issues where women have been at the forefront of affairs. African women are courageous, hardworking and incredibly passionate, but history has not been kind to our stories. Still, this is the Africa I know.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#sdfootnote1anc\">1</a> Fapohunda, Tinuke. (2011). Women and Political Leadership in Nigeria. African Journal of Social Research and Development.

One way to do that is through strengthening the capacity of health systems in Africa and other low and middle-income countries to be able to provide the surgical care that these patients need. I therefore work with Operation Smile and with our various partner foundations around the world to advise on various health systems strengthening projects. Recently, our Operation Smile Ghana foundation was awarded a $1.8 million dollar grant from the Swedish Postcode Lottery to scale up access to speech therapy in Ghana in partnership with the University of Ghana and several hospitals across the country. If successful, this project will ensure that thousands of Ghanaians with speech and language deformities have access to speech therapy.</p>\n<h3>What is your day-to-day like?</h3>\n<p>Most of my work is focused on finding ways to improve access to surgical care in low- and middle-income countries through policy, advocacy, and research. On days focused on research, we do hospital assessments and engage with local leaders and health care providers and patients to assess barriers that they face in either providing or accessing surgical services. We then design research projects around their barriers together, seek funding sources and conduct the research.</p>\n<p>From a policy perspective, we disseminate our research findings to key policy makers at the Ministry of Health to advocate for policy reform based on the evidence-generated from our research and the research of other global health practitioners. For example, after the 2015 publication of the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery that highlighted that up to one third of all deaths and morbidity worldwide was due to a condition amenable to surgical care. The Ministry of Health of Tanzania was compelled to develop a national policy to address surgical conditions in Tanzania. I worked and advised the Ministry of Health on the development of this national policy. The policy, which will cost half a billion dollars over a seven-year period and strengthen surgical services at all major public health institutions in the country, is currently in the implementation phase.</p>\n<h3>Can you tell us what drew you to work in health in the first place?</h3>\n<p>It is simple. I wanted to alleviate suffering and prevent people from dying from conditions that are preventable. It is a deeply personal life goal. I have lost several family members to diseases such as HIV/AIDS and cancers that are preventable. My uncle and his wife died about a month from each other at a young age, leaving their six children orphaned. A few weeks ago, my uncle was diagnosed with a brain tumor and died after an attempted Operation at a large hospital in Yaoundé. This story is not unique to me and there are millions who suffer such pain. I want to relieve this, hence my career choice in health. I believe that improving people's health is an important end, but it will also help to catalyze economic development in Africa and improve livelihoods.</p>\n<h3>Growing up, did you know that you wanted to work in health?</h3>\n<p>Not really. I always imagined I would become an engineer of some sort when I was in high school in Cameroon. However, when I moved to the United States in 2010, I gained a keen interest in health and became very passionate about improving systems of healthcare delivery back home.</p>\n<h3>How was it like growing up?</h3>\n<p>I was born in a relatively poor family to a single mother in a small village in Cameroon. My mother moved to the capital city as a young woman to find a job shortly after I was born. She then brought me to Yaoundé when I was five years old and enrolled me in Primary School. Since I grew up in the village, I spoke no word of English on my first day of primary school and I had a hard time understanding what was being taught in class. However, I had an aunt who lived with us in Cameroon who was a teacher. She taught me diligently every day until I was able to understand what was being taught and learn on my own. From then on, I did very well in Primary School, even skipping a grade. I am always grateful to this aunt, who has now opened a primary and Secondary school and is now teaching a lot more students. I have written about her before here: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6774656291571863552/\">https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6774656291571863552/</a></p>\n<h3>What do you think are the three most imminent challenges to solve in Africa?</h3>\n<p>Rising conflict for example the anglophone crisis in Cameroon. Countries like Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia and the Central African Republic continue to face political instability and conflict among various groups. Until these governance issues are addressed, development will remain a challenge.</p>\n<p>Youth employment also remains unacceptably high in many African countries. Job creation therefore is a major challenge for the next decades. The private sector needs to be stimulated and entrepreneurships supported to address this challenge. Innovation, especially technological innovation in the areas of STEM will be paramount.</p>\n<p>Access to high quality healthcare services remains a challenge for millions of Africans. This is especially pronounced in rural areas where people continue to die from conditions like cholera and malaria that are preventable. Furthermore, noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes and cancers are on the rise as well as injuries and trauma from road traffic accidents. These healthcare challenges not only lead to unnecessary deaths and morbidity but have serious consequences on our economic development.</p>\n<h3>What skills do you think are most critical for young Africans to develop to solve Africa's grandest challenges?</h3>\n<p>Entrepreneurship is a MUST to address the high unemployment rates, young Africans need to be encouraged to be entrepreneurs and supported in this respect. Gone are the days of waiting for the government to employ you after you complete your education. There are just not enough jobs to do so! Young Africans need master skills in entrepreneurship and are supported financially by the public and private sectors.</p>\n<p>Innovation and research: similarly to the above, it will help African youth to be able to compete in global markets. We need to develop skills in identifying innovations to our problems and conducting research that will help in scaling these innovations.</p>\n<p>Political skill: The governance issues that we face in several African countries will be solved by the youth. We must not shy away from politics because the problems are too massive or complex. We must study our history, understand our institutions and its actors, and mobilize efforts to challenge oppressive forms of governance that persist. This will require political skill.</p>\n<h3>What would you say to encourage young Africans to enter STEM?</h3>\n<p>Well, I think STEM is fun! I very much enjoyed studying biological sciences in undergrad. I also believe that STEM degrees allow incredible opportunities to have an impact at a global level. Our daily lives are ameliorated by many products and services offered by STEM from the smartphones we use to access Twitter and KhanAcademy.org to the COVID-19 vaccine that is currently being used to curb this horrible pandemic to the petroleum we use in our cars to the very innovations like electric cars that are being developed to fight climate change. Through STEM you can have an impact in almost every sector of society.</p>\n<h3>What good habits do you think were instrumental to your success?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Set long term goals and map out the most ideal steps to get there. Adjust accordingly depending on the obstacles and challenges that you face along the way.</li>\n<li>Find yourself a model and role model.</li>\n<li>Do not let perfection be the enemy of progress or good. This is especially true in STEM and entrepreneurship. Try to get feedback and test out your ideas as soon as you can.</li>\n<li>Collaborate with others. Two minds are often better than one. Find yourself partners with similar visions to work with and learn from.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Can you tell us more about your education background? How was school for you?</h3>\n<p>I started Primary school in the village but the quality of education there was not great. I moved to Yaoundé in 1997 and completed my Primary school education at Amasia Bilingual School. I was then fortunate through the kindness of some missionary friends to complete my secondary and high school education at an international school in Yaoundé called Rain Forest International School. This opened an opportunity for me to travel to the US for higher education. I completed two years in biotechnology at Delaware Technical Community College in Delaware, three years at Taylor where I obtained my Bachelor of Arts in biological sciences, then did one year at the University of Notre Dame to obtain my master’s degree in Global Health.</p>\n<h3>Tuition is quite expensive in the USA. How did you pay for your studies?</h3>\n<p>I have been extremely fortunate in this domain. Somehow, I completed my education to graduate school without any debts. Obviously, my parents have supported me all throughout my life from Primary School till now, but I would not have the educational opportunities were it not for the generosity of several individuals. In secondary school, missionary family friends (Sue and Patrick Schmidt) saw potential in me and invested in me to go to a missionary school in Cameroon. That opportunity offered me the opportunity to travel to the United States for further education. While at the community college in Delaware, I stayed with my aunts (Anne and Loveline Shey) who were incredibly supportive of me. My time at the community college was extremely challenging because I could not afford the tuition costs having left Cameroon with only enough money for tuition for one semester at the community college. I had to find a way to pay for my tuition for the rest of my three semesters. I worked as a tutor and was able to pay for my second semester. The following year, the Schmidts stepped in again to support me. After community college, relatives of the Schmidts (June and Alfred Barrow) became my host parents and supported me financially to complete my bachelor's degree at Taylor University. I also got a very generous scholarship from their church and from the University. When I was accepted to complete my master’s degree at the University of Notre Dame in 2015, I was offered a full-tuition scholarship from the University to do so. I was extremely grateful for this. Throughout all my education in the US, I worked as an academic peer tutor. I remain forever grateful to all the people I name above and many others who I have not named for believing in me and investing in me to become the person I am today.</p>\n<h3>What are important lessons you have learned on your way to where you are now in your life?</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Your background must not be a limitation to what you can achieve in your life. Do not let it discourage you. Compared to someone born into a rich family, if you are born into a poor family, you will face considerably more challenges to accomplish your life's goals, but it is not impossible. No matter what, you must believe that you can accomplish it.</li>\n<li>Believing that you can accomplish your life's goals is not enough though. You must work hard and work extremely smart to do so.</li>\n<li>Occasional you will meet people who see your hard work and perseverance and will invest in you. When this happens, you have an even greater responsibility to work even greater to make sure that their investments pay off.</li>\n<li>Inspire the next generation whenever you can. There are millions of brilliant minds on the continent who lack the opportunities they need to thrive. The lack the role models they need to emulate. The lack the stories of success of people like them who have made it, that need to be inspired by. Inspire and mentor them whenever you can. Whether it is on the streets or online, tell your story and mentor young Africans. Therefore, the stories being told by \"The Africa I know\" are so important.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What do you like most about Cameroon? How about Ghana?</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>What I like most about Cameroon are my fellow Cameroonians. I am inspired by the ordinary Cameroonian who wakes up early in the morning to</li>\n<li>Ghana for me represents an idea of a great African Future. I have always been inspired by Ghana and Ghanaians in general. I'm a big fan of Kwame Nkrumah who led Ghana to Independence and paved the way for most other sub-Saharan African countries to get Independence.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Can you give us more details about challenges in healthcare, especially for Black/African doctors and patients?  </h3>\n<ol>\n<li>In general, most African countries are faced by a triple threat of communicable diseases (e.g. HIV/AIDS, Ebola, Malaria), noncommunicable diseases (e.g. cancers and diabetes) and a growing burden of injuries (e.g. from road traffic accidents). These are the greatest challenges that African states have to face, and we are not sufficiently equipped to deal with them in terms of the capacity of our health systems. We do not have enough skilled staff, materials (equipment, medicines, supplies etc), infrastructure (hospitals, labs etc) and systems (information systems, referral systems, public health systems) to deal with all of these. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the challenge we face in providing care and preventing diseases on the continent. All these problems will need young people to solve through innovative approaches and leadership.</li>\n<li>Healthcare workers in many of our countries are facing several challenges that prevent them from providing quality care to patients. They often work in very difficult conditions with low remunerations. Immigration of healthcare workers to high income countries remains a major challenge.</li>\n<li>Still our governments spend too little on health which allows this problem to persist. It is still true that in most African countries a majority of the healthcare budget comes from external funding and out of pocket expenditure by patients and their families. This needs to change if we are to address the myriad of healthcare issues we face in sustainable fashion.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Would you change your career path if you had to start over? What would you have changed, if any? </h3>\n<p>If I had to start over, I would not change my career path. It has been a long journey to get to where I am, and I am content with the direction of my career and what I could potentially accomplish. However, I have been flirting with the idea of becoming a writer recently and believe that writing has an incredible ability to create impact.</p>\n<h3>Have you wanted to give up? If yes, what kept you going? </h3>\n<p>I have been demoralized many times, but I have never really wanted to give up on my goal to relieve suffering and prevent the avoidable deaths. I was severely demoralized when I lost my father in the Anglophone crisis in Cameroon a year ago. I questioned what all this was for. He had suffered his entire life in poverty and when things were just about to get better, he got killed. This shook me deeply, but I never thought of giving up. I cannot imagine what giving up looks like. I have to keep fighting for a better future for others and the prosperity of the continent in spite of these setbacks. The vision is beyond me and it is long-term. It will not be accomplished in my lifetime, but I want to contribute what I can such that in the future, no African child dies from a preventable disease or loses their father in an armed conflict like I lost mine.</p>\n<h3>Are you optimistic about the future of Africa? </h3>\n<p>I am and I have to be! It is true that my optimism is often clouded by microevents that make it seem like things are getting worse, for example, the current Anglophone crisis in Cameroon. However, in the broader historical scheme, things are improving; education rates are increasing; healthcare is better than it was a few decades ago. I am also optimistic because I meet many youths around the continent who are eager for change and ready to make it happen. Access to the internet and social media has created this awakening and has provided our youth with an unprecedented access to information.</p>\n<h3>How has growing up in Africa/Cameroon/Ghana shaped you as a person and in your career?</h3>\n<p>\"I am not African because I was born in Africa but because Africa was born in me\" said the great Kwame Nkrumah. I resonate very much with that quote. My Africaness has significantly been accentuated by me living overseas over the past decade.</p>","frontmatter":{"id":"9","slug":"/features/Desmond-Tanko-Jumbam","title":"Desmond Tanko Jumbam grew up in poverty, he is now a Harvard graduate who is fighting for health equity\n","excerpt":"Desmond Tanko grew up in poverty in Cameroon.

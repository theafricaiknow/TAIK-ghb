Tell us about your current occupation, and what is your work about</h3>\n<p>I am currently the Executive Chairman of AllSightsAfrica, a Think Tank and a Policy Institute, which aims to become the 'Brain-Trust' for Governments, NGO's and Private Sector organizations. My work is about fostering the connection between Science, Society, and Business to accelerate Africa's transition to an inclusive innovation economy. AllSightsAfrica aims to \"Connecting Science to Society and Business,\" which we believe is necessary to accelerate Africa's development to an inclusive innovation economy.</p>\n<h3>You hold an impressive number of degrees. Can you enlighten our readers about your educational background?</h3>\n<p>I left Senegal in 1986 after completing high school. I went to Belgium, where I studied first Mathematics and then Applied Physics. I got my MSc in Applied Physics and then completed an MSc in Engineering (Material Sciences), followed by a Ph.D. in Material Sciences specialized in Surface Sciences and Ab Initio calculations (theoretical physics). After completing my Ph.D., I moved to the USA for a 2.5-year Postdoc at the Chemistry and Physics departments of Rutgers University in New Jersey. I worked on several research projects, including nerve cell reconstruction involving my expertise as a surface scientist and Ab Initio calculations involving my Density Functional Theory expertise.</p>\n<h3>How did you pay for your studies?</h3>\n<p>For the first five years, my parents and I paid for it. Teaching private lessons of maths to students in Economy major help me make some money. After that, I was recruited by the University as a researcher, and, therefore, I received full funding. The same holds for my postdoc. I had a postdoctoral scholarship from Rutgers University.</p>\n<h3>What is your day-to-day work like as the Executive Chairman of AllSightsAfrica?</h3>\n<p>For the time being, I am in 'start-up' mode, so my work goes in all directions from content development, to building new partnerships, to strategizing on what the right business model is for Think Tank to fundamental administrative tasks.</p>\n<h3>Can you please tell us what inspired you to found AllSightsAfrica?</h3>\n<p>I am concerned by the fact that at the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, I do not see drastic decisions or actions being taken to leverage the many opportunities ahead of us. Therefore, I decided to create this Think Tank where concrete and implementable solutions are offered to African governments and private sector organizations to tap in. I also believed it was crucial to train our leaders and decision-makers to understand better this complex new era of convergence between the digital, biological, and physical worlds.</p>\n<h3>You have lived in several countries and on three continents. Can you tell us the good habits you think were instrumental to your success?</h3>\n<p>It is imperative to have a balanced life. Your life should not be only about your work. In this stressful time, what helped me was always the combination of studies and sports activities.</p>\n<h3>Have you encountered language barriers? If so, how did you overcome them?</h3>\n<p>Yes, for sure. English was the first one when doing my Ph.D., and it was even more challenging when I moved to the USA. Well, there are no shortcuts. I had to learn the language. Later on, I also learned Dutch when I returned to Belgium since the research center, I worked for was in the country's Flemish part. Well… I learned the language! I think that is the only solution to language barriers… learning!</p>\n<h3>Tell us a little bit about your childhood. How was it like growing up?</h3>\n<p>I grew up in several countries, including Guinee, Belgium, Gabon, and Senegal, where I spent the last years of my childhood. At that time, I believe we all grew up without \"technologies\" in a competitive and robust education system … our daily life was pretty much centered on studies and sports activities! So, getting good grades were what was expected from me.</p>\n<h3>Who were your role models growing up, if any?</h3>\n<p>Interestingly mainly liberation (intellectual, people) heroes of Africa, and I hope our education systems in Africa will continue to teach these heroes' history across the Continent.</p>\n<h3>What would you say to encourage young Africans to pursue scientific careers?</h3>\n<p>We have entered an era driven by knowledge (knowledge-led Economy) and mainly scientific knowledge, where \"sciencepreneurhip\" will play an increasingly important role. They have no other choice than to embrace scientific careers or training; otherwise, they will be leaving another form of colonization.</p>\n<h3>What are important lessons you've learned on your way to where you are now in your career?</h3>\n<p>The main one is always to ask yourself the right and most difficult questions about where you stand. Are you happy? From now, what are your expectations in 10 to 20 or 30 years? Will you have any regrets? Will you feel like you have not tried to do this or 'that'? The right and honest answers to these questions should guide your immediate actions.</p>\n<h3>What was the most challenging hurdle you encountered in your career? How did you overcome it?</h3>\n<p>Well, certainly one of the prejudices… Not sure if I overcome them. But something is certain, we need to change the narrative whenever possible.</p>\n<h3>Any final words for the African youth?</h3>\n<p>I envy you for being a Young African Scientist today. You are living in a World and era full of opportunities. Seize these opportunities and make sure you are an actor of the transformation of the Continent from wherever you are!</p>","frontmatter":{"id":"3","slug":"/features/Youssef-Travaly","title":"Dr. Youssef Travaly is helping accelerate Africa's transition to an inclusive innovation economy","excerpt":"Learn about Youssef Travaly's journey from living in several countries and studying on three continents to developing a 'Brain-Trust' for governmental and non-governmental organizations as the Executive Chairman of AllSightsAfrica.","author":"Kaleab Alemayehu Kinfu, Danielle Tchuinkou","about_author":"","category":"Entrepreneur","subject":"Youssef Travaly","content":"Youssef Travaly is currently the Executive Chairman of AllSightsAfrica, a Think Tank and a Policy Institute.

Can you tell our readers what your current occupation is and what a day at work is like for you?\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n      Temiloluwa O. Prioleau: I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Dartmouth College, a private Ivy League research university in New Hampshire, in the U.S. My day-to-day is dynamic and depends a lot on the academic term. I typically spend my day learning what's new in my research field, meeting with students, brainstorming on current or future projects, preparing course materials, teaching, grading, reading and writing emails, writing research papers, and writing grants applications.\n    </p>\n    <h3>\n      Can you go a little bit in detail about your research? What questions are you interested in solving?\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n      My research is in applied data science. I study how data can be used in creative ways to inform health decisions. This includes using mobile and wearable systems as a source of data collection then analyzing and drawing insights from such data to guide health-related decisions. Currently, I am working on projects concerning diabetes and COVID-19.
